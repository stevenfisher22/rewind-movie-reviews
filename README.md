Rewind Movie Reviews is a movie review and logging app based on the idea of Letterboxd.com. This project came about as a way for me to keep track of my movie watching history and reviews. 

I wanted to practice my skills in React and Redux as well as utilize a back-end comprising Node.js, Express.js, and Postgres for the database.
